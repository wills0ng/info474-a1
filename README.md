## Assignment 1: Visualization Design

In this assignment, you will design a visualization for a small data set and provide a rigorous rationale for your design choices. You should in theory be ready to explain the contribution of every pixel in the display. You are free to use any graphics or charting tool you please - including drafting it by hand. However, you may find it most instructive to create the chart from scratch using a graphics API of your choice.
